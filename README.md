# My Flutter Dev Camp Journey
As part of the Dev Camp organized by Google Developer Group in London, I had the opportunity to design a few simple apps while going over some of the various concepts in Flutter. I built a range of apps, and in some cases, I went beyond assignment specifications and added some different aspects. The freedom of expression on the assignments allowed me to test out and experiment with more widgets from Flutter, like Heros and Chips, to various popular packages, such as Firebase Auth, Riverpod, carousel_slider etc.

## Topics
* Week 1: Flutter Basics
* Week 2: API/HTTP
* Week 3: Flutter Firebase
* Week 4: State Management
* Week 5: Responsive Design
* Week 6: Animation
* Week 7: :test_tube: Testing
* Week 8: Project review and Submission
* Week 9: :man_student: Graduation and QnA

### :shipit: News App
Flutter app that at first started as working with APIs in Flutter assignment. After learning from gurus like [Sumith](https://twitter.com/sumithpdd?s=20&t=r5lM8dd8DlT6MdVNRd7J9Q), [Majid](https://twitter.com/mhadaily?s=20&t=r5lM8dd8DlT6MdVNRd7J9Q) and [Roa](https://twitter.com/roaakdm?s=20&t=r5lM8dd8DlT6MdVNRd7J9Q), the "animation queen" herself, I decided to take it to the next level and am currently extending it to incorporate Firebase (50% pending storing of user articles and sources), Riverpod, some animations and tests (0%). It's named RiverBase news simply because it uses Riverpod and Firebase .. ba-dum-tss
