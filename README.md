# My Flutter Dev Camp Journey
As part of the Dev Camp organized by Google Developer Group in London, I had the opportunity to design a few simple apps while going over some of the various concepts in Flutter. A range of apps were built and in some cases, I went beyond assignment specifications and added some extra aspects to the apps while getting the chance to test out and experiement with more widgets Flutter provides like Heros, and Chips to various popular packages such as firebase, riverpod, isar, carousel_slider etc.

## Week 1: Flutter Basics 
In the first week, two apps were assigned to us with mainly focus on UI and working with fundamental widgets provided by Flutter from Stateful and Stateless widgets to GridView and ListView builders and basic navigation.
